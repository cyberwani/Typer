# Typer

Typer is a tiny jQuery plugin that will clear out an element and type its contents. A demo can be seen on [my site](http://www.stephenradford.me).

## Usage

The usual inclusion of the scripts (you know the drill by now). You can attach with the following options.

    $('#element').typer({
        'speed' : 75, // The speed the text is typed
        'delay' : 1500 // Pause before the script starts
    });

Don't forget to include the CSS for the flashing animation to work correctly,
